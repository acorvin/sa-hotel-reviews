id10327,"I stayed at the Crown Plaza April -- - April --, ----. The staff was friendly and attentive. The elevators are tiny (about -' by -'). The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving!

id10328,"I booked this hotel through Hotwire at the lowest price I could find. When we got there the front desk manager gave us a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""smoking"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room. I argued that I have a little baby and I would not have booked the room had I known it was smoking. The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.
After a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).
The parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old. The only thing available is coffee in the lobby which is decent.
All in all, poor service, minimal amenities, small rooms, small bathrooms, no view, but great location. Some distance from the metro (either McPherson station or Dupont station). Try to look for better if available.",Mozilla,Tablet,0

All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.
The rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.
I did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.
Needless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at.

I particularly enjoyed the wine-tasting evenings & the helpful, polite front desk.
Overall, I'd recommend this place for singles or couples, but for children present, you probably need a bit bigger room. For the location & proximity to everything (including a marvelous little Mexican restaurant around the corner), you can't beat this place for the price. SF is a magical city with plenty of things to do, so I'd recommend just crashing here & seeing the wonderful surroundings more than hanging out in a room all day.

id10338,"We stay at the Jolly Madison over the Xmas period, the main feature is it's location. You are never far from most tourist attractions from this hotel. Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.
Our room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.
We did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.
We took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.
Make sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.
The store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-(
Stumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though.
We did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like.
We were surprised at just how many people there were and how many shops remained open on Xmas day. This really is the town that does not sleep.

The reception staff were really helpful in givin us directions etc. There is a minimart, subway and starbucks just across the road which is convenient. Also just off the walk of fame is a shopping mall with shops like Gap, Superdry, etc. There are also a few restaurants there as well.

Be warned of the way they drive tho, it was a slightly frightening experience after -- hours on a plane! 
We didnt have a car there so did all organised tours, one through VIP tours and one through Starline Tours.

id10345,"The service was fine, but the hotel itself fell way below my expectations from such a respectable establishment as Hilton. They were nickel-and-diming me all the way. 
-. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.
-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.
-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.
-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.
-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. 
-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.
Summarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again.

id10346,"Having stayed at many Hilton properties, I expect a friendly efficient service from what is considered a good brand.
This property was a let down. Initially, things went smoothly. Check-in was fine, as a HHonors Gold member I was informed with an apology that they did not have an Executive Floor to upgrade me to, but put me in a - bedroom suite and offered me a complimentary buffet breakfast and the usual wifi vouchers. This is where the good things ended.
The room had issues. Initially, the phone in the living room did not work. They sent someone up to fix the phone, and then some --- hours later it just started randomly producing high pitched beeps (which in turn woke me up). In addition, the guest compendium was empty (as in someone had removed the pages). It took - phone calls and - people to come up to my room to actually understand what I was requesting, and deliver a full compendium.
I also had cause to contact and visit the front desk at various stages later in the evening during my stay. To say the night staff were next to useless would be an over-statement. The night manager basically said nothing to my requests, or as little as possible. They treated me like I was putting them out of their way and disrupting them being lazy. One particular staff member was so bad I wrote a separate complaint to Hilton about them.
I also witnessed a lady in obvious distress attempting to get a room late one evening. When they informed her she was not able to get a room without photo ID she became upset and aggravated. She ranted a little bit about 'if I get murdered tonight, it'll be on your conscious' to which the night manager replied """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""That's ok Ma'am, I have no conscious"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".

id10348,"I very much wanted to stay at a boutique hotel near Times Square in lieu of a Hilton or Marriott type. After some research, hubby and I compromised on The Paramount after seeing the price of their modern chic rooms on the website. When we checked in we were both excited about the impressive lobby. Very us. BUT we were royally disappointed when we entered our King Deluxe room. Womp womp womp...
I'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.
The pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.
We headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.
We headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadn’t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.
I've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed. No point in showing you the view out the window, it was the back of a building.

We chose this hotel over the other InterContinental in New York City because of the price, location, and previous reviewer's glowing comments. There were a few little details that just didn't compare with previous experience we've had with this hotel brand.
The furniture looked a bit shabby with scuff marks on the table and tired looking furniture, chipped paint. The bathroom had a light fixture hanging loosely from the ceiling. There was some mold on the ceiling in the shower area. There were a couple of times that I had to wait over five minutes for hot water in the bathroom and the bathroom sink had a constant drip. One of our towels had a large hole in it.

The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and - ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee-office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay. 
The Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down -st to Pike Market. It's only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it's only - blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There's even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!) 
Overall, we were so happy with our choice that when we go back to Seattle for whatever reason, we will be staying there. The location, the comfort, the moderate price ($--- a night in Seattle is hard to beat) and the friendliness of the female employees made it a perfect stay!",Firefox,Desktop,1

We had read about slow parking valet times, but our waits for the retrieval of our car averaged two minutes! I suppose if you wanted your car during intervals of high turnover (check-in and check-out), it might takelonger. I suggest you ask the valet staff if you are concerned.
Back to the hotel room,we specified a room with mountain views and got a nice one. Large large bathroom with separate tub and bath appointed with marble floors and granite countertops. rooms facing west in the summer, you might want to leave your AC a little lower before you leave for dinner.

id10362,"I stayed here last Thursday - Sunday. I attended a business workshop on Friday, and my hubby and I stayed through the weekend for leisure. Check-in was smooth and fast, and the staff were courteous and knowledgeable. The lobby is nicely decorated in a contemporary style, but the building sure shows its age once one heads up to the guestroom floors. The woodwork outside our room was so battered looked as if someone had been hacking at it with an ax. 
On the positive side, I liked the overal design of the room, and the bedding was of nice quality. But there were some serious flaws. The bathroom cabinet was cracked so severely that some of the wood veneer had copletely fallen off. And, although I asked for a nonsmoking room, the place smelled strongly of smoke. We are not smokers and didn't spend any time with smokers during our trip, but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room. When we got home and unzipped our suitcases, the smell of smoke was extremely strong. I had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that I had just purchased that very weekend at Saks.
Other positives about this hotel are the location. It was very convienient to Magnificent Mile shopping and attractions. The cafe attached served great coffee, and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order. And, again, the staff were helpful and pleasant.

id10364,"My first stay at a Kimpton property was on a Friday, for a business trip in DC. I booked a room at Donovan House with - criteria in mind: location, and value. The location of the hotel was convenient, as it was near the National Mall and government offices but also within - mile of several other points of interest. I based value on the overall perks-to-cost ratio. It's not scientific, but based on the feeling of, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""did I get a good deal?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The first impressiom of the services was upon entering the parking garage. Valet parking is available on-location, but for the steep price of $---day. They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn't have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn't my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.
Upon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite. Softening the blow was the fact that I had arrived just before wine hour, which, according to my research is a standard Kimpton perk. Sweet. After pushing my way past a bellhop carriage stacked with supply boxes, I waited for the elevator in the narrow corridor. On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival. The rest of the room was exceptional: crisp Sferra linens on the bed and duvet, a clean bathroom with a large soaking tub and designer shower that were consistent with the other elements. After a quiet and comfortable night's rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to enjoy the rooftop pool and bar that are features of the property. Overall rating: ----.

Took orange line from Midway, got off at the Library stop and short walk to hotel. Right across the street is a Ginos so if you need your fill of Chicago deep dish, Ginos is there to assist. 
The hotel is quaint. Older buildings which have been merged to house the rooms. Very good service from check in to check out. At night, a bar is beside the lobby area with comfortable seating. Very relaxing space. As for the room, I was a large room with a King bed. Clean. The bed was very comfortable with crisp linens. Decor was fresh. View out of the window was the brick wall of the building next door. Did not bother me as I was only in the room to sleep and do some end of the day work. The bath was also very good size with a walk in shower....very nice. Another reviewer noted the rain head for the shower and low pressure. I will take the other side of the commentary. The pressure in the shower was very good and I loved the oversized rain head. If you did not like the downward stream, you could direct it slightly to get more of a traditional shower experience. I liked it so much, I am adding one to my soon the be remodeled bath. The only negative about the shower was the caulking had some mold.

From the moment we walked into the clean and accommodating lobby, to the check in process, room (more on that in a moment!), and most importantly - a most professional, helpful and awesome staff.
We were blown away. I've stayed in Manhattan more times than I can count - this is by FAR the best hotel experience I've had (sorry Ritz.)
We were upgraded to the Penthouse level (yay Hyatt rewards program!). Oh-em-gee .... a roof patio! The room was gigantic - especially by NY standards. The lounge is awesome and I'm in love with their espresso machine. The concierge was very helpful and we had a few ideas where we wanted to dine the last night and Eataly was great experience. She suggested it for a unique experience over the hotel restaurant. 
Most of all - the staff went above and beyond. Jordan was so awesome - he handled our check in (room wasn't quite ready, so he had us relax in the lounge while he handled check in) and he risked life and limb during an epic thunderstorm on our -nd day to score us a taxi to get to an appointment on time.

The room was nice - recently re-done. Very comfortable. 
Oddly, about - floors' worth of the soda machines didn't work. We reported it to the front desk.
The parking situation was weird, since it doesn't belong to the hotel, I think. Hotel guests park on floors four through seven of the garage off to the side, but it seems to be event parking as well. We had to stalk parking spots, since it was really crowded, and some jerks in giant cars took up more than one parking spot. We could have done the valet parking, but the self-park was a great deal ($--, I think).
The workout center was in need of more ventilation (older building - window a-c units), and it is a little small, but they have what you need: cardio machines, free weights and a bench, and a multi-station weight machine.

Our room was a surprise, it was quite big and even though the decor was a little busy, we did like it, the bathroom was large, with good qaulity fixtures. The bath towels and robes were light and fluffy and the tioletries were replaced everyday. The soaps they use a lovely too, and WOW what a great shower. 
The room itself had a very large flat screen TV mounted on the wall, we also had a floor to ceiling mirror on one wall and floor to ceiling windows. The bed was super-king size and the bed was very comfortable. As we are super fussy on bed quality we did make sure the beds were pillow-top and it was like a big marshmellow.
All the fixtures and fittings, looked to be brand new. Be warned though as some of the mini bar items, water, ect, snacks are placed on the tray with your glasses and cocktail shakers and they are not free.

(Tip: Listen to the SD natives who kind of look askance when the idea of visiting Old Town is the topic. We didn't take their advice and ended up being seriously underwhelmed by Old Town and its surroundings. Instead, visit Coronado Island if you have a free afternoon during your conference. Those few hours along the beach and walking through the town on a sunny afternoon were the most memorable and pleasant of all during our SD stay.) I would recommend this hotel to friends only after it finishes renovations.",Edge,Desktop,1

After learning that this was a top rated hotel in Philly, I decided to give it a try. Everything was perfect, and the staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful! The room was very clean, modern, a good size, and ours had a nice view of the city. The hotel is in the Rittenhouse Square area, which has excellent restaurants and shopping. And they offered several perks for our stay - a later checkout time, a place to store our luggage after checkout (so my wife and I could spend more time in the city), and restaurant recommendations. They even left us two bottles of water and popcorn in our car, when it was picked up from valet parking!

The concierge tried to rip me off on a ride to the airport and when I questioned her overpriced quote, she told me that if I didn't like it, go ask the doorman for advice on car services.
One elevator was out of service, yet they didn't tell me that when I made the reservations. I had this problem once before during holiday time with a NY hotel, so had I have known, I would have made other accommodations.
One night, there were dirty towels or something left in the sink by the housekeeper that day, who obviously was in so much of a rush, she left the items in the sink. Disgusting.
When I made reservations and then when I checked in, I asked for a room with a view. My view was the back alley next door. Bait and switch.
The hotel room and whole hotel is shabby. I tried to move out to another hotel the day I checked in, but being Thanksgiving week, it was hard to find other accommodations since the city is full. I got a survey from Affinia a week later, when I told them of the rude staff, rude concierge and lack of services they said they would make it up to me. They lied, They gave me nothing and ignored the problem. I will avoid all Affinia Hotel's in the future. They don't care about the guests at all.",Internet Explorer,Mobile,0

I asked to be switched to a different room because I didn't even feel safe in the one that I was in. The second room was larger, but not any better.

Whenever you look, you see very outdated details.
Another bad thing about the hotel is the fact that you can hear almost everything that is going on next door! And I mean EVERYTHING! You hear when people get up, go to the bathroom, whisper!! One night I was even fricked out because I thought someone was trying to come in to my room, although in reality my neighbour attempted to come in next door.

But, our view from the room of the harbor was lovely.
Service: There could be more front desk staff. During our stay, it seemed like the young lady working the front desk was extremely busy and she was the only person at the front desk working until the next morning. Inspite of this, she provided great service. The bottle of wine upon check-in is a nice touch.
Food: the continental breakfast was fantastic and was one of my favorite aspects of the hotel. The continental breakfast offered nice variety and the fool was delicious. The woman who tended to the breakfast was friendly and efficient; she provided great service.
Value: Truly, the only issue I had with the hotel was the price. It's an expensive hotel for what one receives. My wife and I have been fortunate to travel and stay in some great hotels worldwide and it seems in our travels; we have experienced more for what we paid for at other hotels than what we paid for at the Henderson's Wharf Inn.

I felt like reaching across the counter and planting one on the nice young man! I was escorted up to my suite and absolutely giddy with delight as this never happens to me. The suite was spectacular! The living room was very large for NYC standards and had a plasma tv in the armoire. The bedroom was equally large and spacious and the bathroom was done in marble. I only wished my stay was to be longer than -- hours.
The complimentary breakfast can be delivered to your room for only $-.

What sets the Elysee apart is the staff. Each request or inquiry was met with a professional response. The hotel is boutique style so its very intimate and the staff addresses you on a first name basis, making it feel like home. 
I travel to NYC quite a bit for business and pleasure and I have tried them all, but this will be my new home away from home. The abundant complimentary breakfast, wine and cheese and free wi-fi make the Elysee such a great value. And no, its not cheap, but what is in NYC?

id10423,"My stay at the W City Center was a Dr. Jekyll- Mr. Hyde type ordeal. For every task that they did well, there was an equal and opposite task that flopped. 
As a former frequent traveler I have stayed in many different hotels ranging from - stars to - stars. And, lately, I have been having good, solid experiences booking - star hotels for my leisure trips through priceline, but my stay at the W City Center in Chicago ended that string of luck.I had read many other reviews on this website before my trip and I felt like I had enough information to know what to expect, but I was wrong.
I rated my experience at the W a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but it was closer to a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-.--"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and just like in math class, I rounded down. I am not sure what the exact criteria is for star ratings, but for service, the W City Centre is a solid """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-.-,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but that's as good as it gets.
My flight landed at Midway at about -:-- am, so I took the Orange line and arrived at the hotel at around --:-- am. I was expecting to check my luggage, but to my surprise I was able to check-in. And, according to them, they upgraded my bed from full to queen and gave me a courtyard view on the --th floor, so that noise from the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""L"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" wouldn't bother me. What a joke!!! 
My bed wasn't even a full, it was more like a double... maybe even a twin-and-a-half. My wife and I, who sleep in a King at home, were practically on top of each other. And the courtyard view, looked more like the view from a project in Brooklyn. And, I understand that the interior rooms in the hotel have no choice but to have a view like that, but please don't tell me it's an upgrade, when it really isn't. I would have rather heard the train and had a view of the outside world, than to feel like I was in prison.
The room was tiny! After I learned was staying at the W, I looked it up and saw that the rooms were small, but the website doesn't do the room justice. There was exactly enough room to turn around, but that was about it. there was a lounge chair in the corner that was unecessary in that size room and the desk where one could use a laptop was at the foot of the bed. When you pulled the chair out to take a seat, it hit the foot of the bed, so you had to squeeze into the space between the desk and the chair. At -'-"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", --- lbs, I'm not a huge man, but it was a feat for me to do that.
The television was in a cabinet to the left of the bed, so I had to turn my head at an awkward angle to view it. And, the question that kept running through my mind was, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""If this is a - star hotel, where is the plasma TV?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I have stayed at many other - star hotels in Chicago that have had plasma for years and if I remember correctly the W Lakeshore has plasma TV's in it's rooms. 
I liked the fact that there was a safe in the room for my valuables, it made me feel much more comfortable about leaving certain things in the room. But, it was a too small for my laptop.
The bathroom was also very tiny, but it had a full-sized tub and a fantastic shower head. Also, the little Bliss sample products were great so I purchased full-sized versions. The toilet was extremely noisy, but I believe I figured out why. The flush was a little longer and stronger than a usual toilet, but I think it was so that all """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""debris"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" could be cleaned with one flush instead of possibly flushing more than once. I mean it's so loud, the flushing next door would wake my wife in the middle of the night.
The service at the door was great, but it came in spurts. At one point there might be three gentlemen opening the door, but at others there might not be any, only the person that hails cabs for you and if your hands are full and he's busy, then you're stuck! I didn't see a handicapped button you can push to open it automatically.
The location is decent. You're very close to the Orange and Brown line trains, two blocks from the Blue line and - or - blocks from the Red line. And, unless you're going out at midnight, like we did, there is usually a cab in the vicinity.
Overall, this is not a - star hotel. You either have great service or none at all and I didn't appreciate being misled to think I was receiving some sort of benefit. I decided not to patronize the restaurant (Shikago) or bar (Whiskey Blue) because there are many other places in Chicago I'd rather spend my money. Please do your research.

That said, it's still a cheap hotel. And in my case, a smelly one. Perhaps it was just this room, though I doubt it. The elevator area had a chokingly bad smell as well.

The room was comfortable, but here's a disclaimer. Because of the funky W styling, there are a set of shutters in a window that seperates the bathroom from the sleeping area. If you're traveling with a companion, this would not allow for much privacy, but if you're traveling alone it enables you to see the view of the lake while you're literally standing in your shower.

First off, I'd called about parking and was told the rate was $--, I specifically asked if that were per day or for then entire stay and the hotel said the entire stay, you pay once (I called hotel directly). Not so. So right off the bat another fee adding to an overpriced room. Our room is a double suite and very small. The electrical outlets are jammed, the lights turn on and off consistently. The hotel staff said, that happens. Our TV would not work, and internet access? No luck there either.

As others have commented, the rooms are a bit tired, but the huge king size bed was comfy and everything was clean. Our tour guide must have let the hotel know that it was my birthday and there was a lovey card and bowl of fruit in the room when we arrived. The hotel was pretty busy as it must be a popular stop for bus tours; the staff were pleasant, but obviously rushed. Prices in the on site restaurant looked okay.

When the staff learned of our trouble they went above and beyond to help us find a solution to the problem.They even tried to find us a different hotel close to the area we wanted to be in. We ended up staying at the Affinia in one giant room with two king beds. The room was above our expectations. We did cut our vacation short because of the snafu but it had nothing to do with the treatment we received at the Affinia.

I still got a paper, for instance, even though my rate was --% off. Normally deeply discounted fares or Priceliners are given a little less goodness. Free laundry for guests, also. And everyone was a concierge. . .if they didn't know how to get to the restaurant or attraction you wanted, they would find the person who knew momentarily.
Perfect, perfect, staff.
ONLY NEGATIVEs:
-. Rooms are a bit small for this price range, but very clean and nice, and the location of this hotel is amazing, but you pay for it.
-. One night, Sunday, I went to the pool (around -pm local time) and the skimmer-pump was turned off, so the water was stagnant and kinda cloudy. I don't know if it was just bad timing, but it was a big turnoff. Otherwise the facilities are very clean. If the pool is open til midnight (which is generous), keep the pump on, please.
Overall excellent experience, but with --% in taxes on top of your room rate, you can easily spend three hundred a night and I don't know if location and magical service is worth that.",Chrome,Tablet,1
id10439,"I stayed here one night on a business trip. Got a great rate compared to the downtown hotels. This is the only hotel that is at the entrance to the airport, so if you want an airport hotel, this is it. It is also right in the middle of the marina with boats and beautiful views in every direction. 
Check in was quick because it was late night. Got upgraded as a SPG member even though I was paying a very low rate. The room was bigger than average because of the curvature of the room. Exceptionally clean with --"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" flat tv and nicely decorated. King bed was big and comfortable. I only heard one plane before I dozed off, but the room is sound proofed well. 
The lobby is bigger then most hotels downtown. It has a great social-computer center with free Internet and computer use. There are two restaurants and two different bars, and a full service Starbucks. Although the prices for food in the bar were high, I think they are on par with most - star hotels. While the menu had some high priced items, there were many items in the $----- range. 
Although parking is $--, this is the same if not less than what many - star hotels charge downtown. I have paid as much as $--. 
Since there are dozens of hotel choices in the downtown area, this hotel only makes sense for me if I don't need to get around the city. Although only - miles from the heart of downtown, it is on a peninsula and a little detached from anything other than the marina and airport. On the other hand, it's location provides great views, particularly at sunrise and sunset while viewing the big city in the background.",Mozilla,Desktop,1

Great, polite, accomodating service without the snooty attitude common at so many other famous places; small and intimate ambience- the doormen will remember you! ; understated and classy lobby and bar; great location. Despite recent renovation still feels like Dorothy Parker would be at home here.

A couple of little niggles - there's no out of hours rooms service at all, and also no way to make tea or coffee in your room. If there's no room service, they should at least give you a kettle.

The next morning I spoke with a very pleasant rep “Angela” at the front desk I explain the situation of the parking and AAA, she begins by apologizing she tells me how the discount works which is not how I was told over the phone the -nd time; I was unable to get the AAA discount but I did get - days of free parking worth $-- a day and a bottle of wine for my birthday which I was very satisfied with.

id10446,"This hotel is what you would generally expect a Homewood Suites to be like. The staff was very friendly from check-in to check-out of my two week stay. Breakfast was usually hot, and there was always enough food out. There is a Manager's Reception each Monday-Thursday night like at all Homewood's, but I did not attend one of those so I can't comment on the quality. The rooms are awesome. I was fortunate enough to be able to book a fireplace suite. They provide you one firelog for free, but any remaining logs you must buy yourself. They do sell them at the front desk, but if you are going to use more than - I would simply buy them from the nearby Target or Walmart for cheaper. The suite was very spacious. The bedroom itself is the size of your common hotel room. The living area have both a semi-comfortable chair, and a not so comfortable at all couch. The kitchens are equipped with a stove top and microwave, but there is no oven which I find to be a negative. At the very least, a convection oven combined with the microwave would be nice. You will not have a problem finding a place to store your luggage as there are plenty of closets and two sets of drawers. My room also had a patio which would be a nice addition for the Summer months. Some very important advice is that there is a railroad track that runs adjacent to this property. If you are a HiltonHonors member, you are given to option to select your room before you arrive. Rooms on the South side of the property and on the East side of the property are ones to stay away from if you are a light sleeper. My room was in the Southeast corner of the property (the absolute worst place) so I could actually feel the floors shake when the trains went by. Luckily I am not a light sleeper. As far as location, it is a short drive to several restaurants and a great shopping mall. Of course, not all business travelers have the luxury of a rental car so it is nice to be able to walk to restaurants. Well, that will not happen if you stay here. However, they do provide a shuttle that will take you anywhere within a - mile radius. I did not use the shuttle, so I can't comment on how convenient it is.

We visited the bar and ordered a cheese plate (rather plain) and drinks (fresh and delicious). The prices were typical for a hotel bar but the service was friendlier and more attentive than most we've visited. The bar is small but open to the street so there was still plenty to see.

They have a nice property, but to advertise it as a Four Star Hotel is misleading. I would have to compare it to a Springhill Suite or Holiday Inn Express just without a Concierge.

We ended up in one on the --th floor with a view up -th Avenue where you could see the beginning of Central Park. Plus, we had a partial view of the Chrysler Building.
I'll start with what is good about this hotel. First of all, the front desk staff is very efficient, helpful and friendly. The free breakfast is quite adequate---decent food if nothing to write home about. Also, the maids who cleaned our room during the course of the week did a great job. It also appears that the bed sheets have improved---they are a much higher thread count than what was there previously.
So...how is it slipping? The furniture is starting to get shabby. The hotel is only - years old but hotel furnishings seem to take a real beating. The granite countertop on the kitchen table had some indelible stains. However, what really got to us is this --- everyday the towels and wash cloths smelled unclean and were dingy. Plus some were even ripped or looked flea-bitten. This was very off-putting. Also, the hot water tended to go out from time to time. During peak times when many are showering, it is understandable. However, when it's a time of day when most people are out, it's really inexcusable. Speaking of the plumbing---the toilet often had to be flushed twice---not good!
We never experienced these issues during our last stay two years ago. What's up with that? Is the hotel cutting corners when it comes to properly laundering the towels? Are the plumbing problems being worked on?
Would we stay here again? The verdict is still out on that one. What I'm going to do is closely monitor the reviews here to see if things improve. If they have, we certainly would stay again.",Mozilla Firefox,Tablet,0

In addition the door onto the corridor was close to the neighbouring rooms and I could hear them come and go too. This room is convenient for the lift being just around the corner but also able to clearly hear conversations of people getting in-out of the lift saying good bye to friends etc.
I was staying at this hotel for one night only and so didn't ask to swap rooms. Also the noise did not become apparent until mid way through the evening. It got a little quieter later in the night but I could have done with a long restful sleep in preparation for my transatlantic flight the next day.

Finally, their bag check was efficient, well run, and very good. 
On the other hand, there were many many issues. First and foremost, our bathroom flooded. It happens. They were quick in fixing it but it's still an issue. They also forgot our towels one day, though they did deliver new ones upon being told. Their website was also very inaccurate as it advertised free wireless internet in the common areas despite there being no such service. On top of that, they lacked a book of amenities in the room and did not provide one; being hungry at - AM and wishing for room service or some sort of map, we were unable to procure one. The website was also very unhelpful, lacking hours and locations of things. Finally, it seemed that getting a card remagnitized without all four cards there would reset all cards and prevent them from working, meaning that by the end of the trip, we had only a single working card and no real means of obtaining new working ones. 
The neutral in this case was the room situation. We had - people in a room, one of which did not wish to share the bed and as he was paying, one had to sleep on the floor, me.

The rooms (I had two) were nothing special but ok, both equipped with modern furniture, flat screen TV and internet access, cleanliness was also ok. The breakfast could be better but is fair.
So far so good but the building has an immense problem with noise exposure. The rooms are extrem clairaudient.

id10498,"My son and I stayed here over spring break. I got a room here at a very good price - almost as low as the cost of a nearby hostel. The room was very clean. I read a few reviews that said the rooms were small, but considering the size of an apartment in NYC, I didn't think it was that small. We had two double beds, and if we had been traveling with a third person, we probably could have squeezed in a rollaway bed. The bathroom was very clean and looked like it had been recently updated. 
A couple of cons - there was no screen on the window. We were on the --th floor and the window opened all the way, but there was no screen or any other safety feature. The bottom of the window is about -.- feet off the floor, so I kept having panic thoughts of my son (who was -- YEARS old at the time) tripping and falling out the window...a little paranoia there. lol However, I would not recommend this for someone traveling with a small child. Also, I could have sworn the rooms were advertised as having air conditioning. This one did not. I'm guessing they put window units in during the summer, but since it was still March, they hadn't put them in yet (it was unseasonably warm while we were there). That's just my guess, anyway.
The other thing that was a little odd was that the door lock looked like it had been broken before. I suppose if someone is really paraniod, this might be an issue. However, they have someone at the front desk -- hours a day. As a matter of fact, when you go out, they ask that you give them your room key and they will give it back when you return. Unheard of in this day, but it was kind of cool because you get to know the front desk people and they get to know you. They will ask for ID if they don't recognize you, but otherwise, they'll just give you your key. Again, I suppose if someone is super paranoid, this might be an issue, but I felt very safe there - more safe than staying at a motel with outside entry in the middle of nowhere. 
Also, if you're not used to sleeping in a noisy city, I would recommend bringing ear plugs. The windows are super thin and you can hear traffic and people ALL NIGHT - it is only a couple of blocks from Time Square, so be prepared for traffic noise. I actually slept with a white noise track on my MP- player all night, and as soon as I dozed off, I didn't notice the noise anymore.

No welcoming words or offers to store bags, just """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""either you can wait here or come back.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In fact, more than - hours was problematic and he simply wouldn't do it despite the fact that they had a system for it in place. So - nights of staying and I couldn't store my bag for a full day until we went to the airport. 
He yelled at me telling me to get out when I decided his tone and language had gone too far. I let him know I had been coming there for some time and my company uses it and I would expect if not service a kinder approach. I guess that is what we get for looking for value.... We spent our last day lugging our bags around town.

id10521,"My wife and I stayed one night at the fairly new JW Marriott in Indianapolis in mid-July. We normally stay at the Conrad what visiting Indy but decided to try out the new hotel. 
The hotel is over-sized - probably -X the size of the Conrad. Almost reminds one of a Vegas-style hotel. The styling of the hotel is very modern-eclectic - it stands in sharp contrast to the more conservative and traditional Conrad styling. I personally prefer the Conrad but I'm sure others will prefer the JW. The JW lobby is loud and busy - Conrad is quiet and reserved.
The service was generally pretty good - however, the luggage did take over -- minutes to get to the room. I finally went down stairs to retrieve the luggage at which point the bell man brought it up. We did not order room service or eat at the restaurants so we got little exposure to the service other than the valet, which was fine.
The room view was spectacular. We were on the top floor and had an end room - two walls with floor to ceiling glass. Amazing. This is one area that the Conrad can not complete with JW - the views. Otherwise, the room was like the lobby - more modern in design. The office chair looks like something from my parents --'s kitchen. Take note: the bathroom does NOT have a tub - least not in our room. Also, the room did not have a couch (which you get at the Conrad) although there is room for one. But overall the room was very nice, beds were comfortable.
The pool is very small - smaller than Conrad and I do not like the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""raised"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" design of the pool. Hot tub was nice sized and the excerise facility was very large. One area where the Conrad is obviously superior to the JW is the changing-shower facilities for the pools and excercise rooms. There is no comparison. Conrad feels like an exclusive golf club with dry-wet sauna, multiple showers, many free amenities etc. The JW feels like a public changing area with no saunas and few free amenities. The Conrad comes equipped with robes and they are nowhere in sight at the JW. 
The presence of a Starbucks in the meetings area is a nice feature.
Overall, the new JW is a great new hotel in Indy but my vote is still that Conrad is a distant first. If you are an executive used to high-end treatment, it's my opinion the JW probably will not quite satisfy like the Conrad.",Mozilla,Mobile,1

Good location for me, but I don't know if I'd pick this spot if I was a tourist. It was nice to be near the food court at the Liberty Place and the other restaurants around within walking distance, but most of the tourist stuff wasn't around where I was located. 
The service was great. Everyone from the front door staff to the folks at the front desk to the people with guest services-room service were very nice. On a couple of different occasions, my room key failed to work, and the staff was great about having new cards programmed for me so I didn't have to wait too long. Prices through room service and down at the restaurant were a little steep, but probably not much different from other big cities. 
In general, I'd say room cleanliness was pretty good. There were a couple of questionable stains on the wall near the bed, as well as a couple on sheets-pillowcases on certain days. Also, there was one day where I found a wash cloth with a red spot. I tossed it on the floor, assuming housekeeping would replace it. The next day when I picked up a new wash cloth from the counter, I found another red spot...surprisinly similar to the one from the previous day. No proof it was indeed the same...but no proof it wasn't.
The heavenly beds are still pretty good...not as fantastic as I remember from my last Westin stay, but since I wasn't getting a ton of sleep at night anyway, it wasn't really mattering much.

Here's a idea, bathrooms are a tool for your stay they need to provide a function and when it's over designed for visual appeal it looses the function. A two inch deep sink does one thing... it splashes water, most of it on you.

It is also in front of the of the shower handles and the shower door does not slide.

Some other things might help this hotel get the - or - rating the would like and that is don't let the city or whoever position a giant dumpster in front of your hotel.

id10537,"We have stayed in the Charlotte area a number of times but never before at the Marriott City Center. The location suited our needs perfectly for this particular trip.
 The check-in and bellman staff was exceptionally courteous and quite efficient. The lobby was attractive and well-maintained. Self-parking in the garage is not difficult once you navigate the very sharp and narrow curve in the entrance ramp. It felt reasonably safe and well lit. Our room was a bit small but certainly clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced given our discount (AAA, AARP, and Marriott- sponsored packages all work out to pretty much the same weekend discount). 
BUT, and here is why I only rate our stay neutral and consider even that somewhat generous:
We were there on Friday and Saturday nights. Friday night we were awakened by extremely loud voices and laughter in the hallway right outside our room on an upper floor. I peeked out the security peephole and saw a group of well-dressed young people. they were calling to each other from doorway to doorway, down the hall, and generally behaving as though they were in a college dorm on a weekend night. I assume we were the unfortunate hallmates of people who had attended a very successful rehearsal dinner or other youth-oriented event where a lot of alcohol had been consumed and the reality of being in a grownup setting had been forgotten. I called the desk to complain and after five minutes the noise subsided somewhat, whether because the celebrants realized their behavior was unacceptable or because someone came up from the desk to tell them to be quiet I do not know.
Saturday night was much worse and something the hotel should have controlled. The relatively unobtrusive thumping music we had heard and ignored in the background Friday night had become a major annoyance, blasting up to our high-floor room for hours. We tried to go to sleep about --:--; it continued until after - a.m. Several times between - a.m. and - a.m. I called the desk and was told various things, among them that there had once been a club nearby that caused noise problems and the problem had just reappeared.... they were sending someone across the street to complain to the club...not clear if they were calling police, Not quite clear how many other people if any had called to complain this particular night, It was as loud as if we were on the street right outside the club--but keep in mind that not only were we on a high floor, we had our windows closed, and the air conditioning was on. 
I suppose that on a week night for business travelers the Marriott Ceity Center is still a viable option, but I don't know the club habits of Charlotte--perhaps even on a week night there might be an issue. Unless I were to be told with certainty that the club noise was no longer an issue I would not stay at this Marriott again despite its excellent location. I am also disappointed that although my husband included a comment about the excessive noise and poor response from staff in his response to the standard """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""how was your visit"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" survey he received upon our return home, we have received no reply or acknowledgment of any kind--nearly a month after the survey was returned.",Edge,Tablet,0

Room: The room was facing the garden, basically it faced a palm tree but it was ok, it provided good shade and kept the place cooler. All amenities were available in the room. Bathroom was ok.

 I usually stay fairly neat, and need little service from the maids.

I brought two different friends by, and since the door locks to the elevator and she buzzes you in after she identifies you, she needs an I'd from any visitor's .

Pros: One of the better locations in downtown Austin. You're within reasonable walking distance of South Congress restaurants and trailers and the -th street entertainment district.

We reserved two rooms, an interior queen and a deluxe room. The queen, as expected, was very small although the decor made up for the size. The deluxe room had a 'view' but unfortunately our window looked into the scaffolding of the building across the street. When you stay there, request a higher floor (-rd or higher) facing the water.

The room itself was clean and tidy however as the room was located near the junction of two roads and two sets of traffic lights the lack of soundproofing was apparent when we entered the room, we believed however that the traffic noise may ease as the evening drew on - WRONG...My family and I were not able to get any sleep due to the constant road noise which rather than getting better later as we had anticipated just got worse - we could hear car radios as they sat at the junction amongst other general traffic noise and road cleaning etc. Quite clearly the soundproofing to the room is inadequate and not the sort of night anyone who has travelled the distance we had wants on their first night in the US.
The next morning my husband complained about the noise and the receptionist said she could move us to another room. We moved to the other room in the morning and then went out as we had travel plans for that day. Upon returning to the room we could hear noise once again - can you believe it we had been put over what I can only imagine was the air conditioning generator or similar, there was a constant noise all night long....how glad were we that we did not have to spend another night here.
Whilst the hotel was clean and tidy and the rooms were adequate we felt very upset that we had been treated so badly. After complaining about the noise on the first night we thought that the staff would have tried at least to give us a room with no noise or even an upgrade but no they did the complete opposite and put us back in the same position.

It was fine and met all of my expectations - the staff were friendly and very welcoming; the room was clean and comfy; the bed was very comfortable and the air was breathable; and the location was just what I needed.
It is a slightly out of the way corner and if you're new to NY you might be a bit spooked by the environment in the nearby block or two, since there are wholesale flower warehouses, downmarket shops and at the moment there is lots of construction going on.

Rooms included standard features, but a room with two beds seemed a bit cramped. Included photos were taken upon --pm arrival, in low light, with a phone, so apologies for quality.
Breakfast offerings were vast, and possibly the best I have seen for deluxe continental. Make your own waffles, hot breakfast sandwiches, cereals, yogurts, fruits, bagels, pastries, and a variety of beverages.
When arriving without checked baggage, I suggest calling for the shuttle as soon as you walk off the plane to avoid long wait at curbside. Hotel shuttle returns to airport on the hour, so plan accordingly when checking out.",Chrome,Mobile,1

id10619,"I go back and forth whether to stay at the Regency or at the Grand Hyatt when I'm at DFW. I ususally choose the Grand Hyatt if the rates are similar, but the Regency will offer rate specials and discounts that the Grand typically doesn't. That was the case during my most recent stay, when I took advantage of a AAA rate that was half the rate of the Grand Hyatt. As always, the rooms were clean and comfortable. This property will try to accomodate their Diamond tier members with upgrades whenever possible. I've been upgraded to a VIP suite on a few occassions, including this stay. THANK YOU SO MUCH, Hyatt Regency DFW!! Your best customers REALLY appreciate the unsolicited upgrades! The VIP suites are super comfy with a well appointed living room-kitchen-and upgraded bathroom.
Breakfast was average and probably a little lower quality than I normally find at Jacob's, but it was fine. 
For those that shy away from staying at the airport hotels because of parking, both Hyatt properties validate parking tickets for overnight guests. (free)

If you're looking to stay in the heart of San Francisco, with easy access to mass transit and the major attractions, this is a good bet.

Cable routes are within several blocks. 
The drawbacks are the rooms are small. We should have had more pillows in the room. If you are renting a car from the airport, they do not have on-site parking, so you will have to park down the street. But try taking an airport shuttle instead and see if you can take in the sites on foot.

I could have complained and gotten another room but my wife and family were asleep and exhausted so I chose to endure the horrible experience for the night. In total, I think I finally fell asleep around -am and slept for -.- or - hours. 
Disgruntled in the morning, I still washedup up in the nasty bathroom and used hand towels to dry myself off since my wife used the only non-stained bath towel we had. We went down to breakfast and had a decent breakfast buffet (free since we are Hitlon Gold Members). After packing up and coming downstairs for our --:-- transport, I thought the worst was over. I made my complaints about the above to the front desk to just """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""let her know"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and the lady just seemed to take some notes and said thanks for letting us know. At that point, I didn't really care anymore since I just wanted to be off on a good cruise and have no more worries about the crappy hotel experience.
We get into the transport vehicle, and my wife and I get into the back seat, and what did the driver have playing on the stereo? Unedited rap music with explicit sexual lyrics including all types of profanity that could send you down to he final level of hell. Once all passengers were loaded into the vehicle, the driver did NOT turn off the music or change the station! 
This is the absolute WORST hotel experience I have ever had. I will NEVER stay at it again even if it were free, and I will make sure none of my friends or family ever have to go through what I went through again.",Mozilla,Mobile,0

The place is really old, in desperate need of an update in every way. The bathroom was dingy and my toilet ran constantly after it was flushed. Also, the bathtub was really scuzzy. There was no hairdryer, just a holder for one. When I called the front desk and asked for a replacement they told me they did not have any spare dryers. They also didn't provide conditioner for your hair. I found several tears in my comforter. Overall, the whole place just needs improved lighting. It's dim, including the lobby, and it makes the whole place seem depressed. Honestly I didn't feel completely safe there. I'm sure I was, but the dim and drab atmosphere really gave me the creeps.

Our expectations were exceeded at every turn. Yes, the location is fantastic. But the hotel did not disappoint in any way!

Our king bed had a fabulous red coverlet and upholstered to the ceiling headboard to match. Mmmm. We had a minibar fridge that had room for our stuff. Bed and pillows were great. And they do this window treatment that is difficult to describe but so lovely.
OK, let's discuss the bar. We were out late, came in for a nightcap. The music was loud, the lighting was dim, the cocktails were a perfect nightcap. The feel was very sexy, and we had a great time.
Asked for a late checkout, no problem at all,and they stored our luggage until our matinee got out. Miguel even helped me walk our stuff across the street in the freezing cold! Yes, by the way, there's a parking garage right across the street with a nice discount.

First of all, it was under a $--- a night, which is unheard of in Chicago, unless you're seeking out hostiles. The location was ideal, within walking distance from the majority of the downtown attractions, including the Willis Tower SkyDeck, Millennium Park, the Art Institute and Buckingham Fountain. (Which is good, because we found the the subway line wasn't very helpful for tourist destinations.) The room itself, while quite small, was tastefully decorated, immaculately clean and very comfortable. I only noticed noise from other rooms on one night, the rest of the time you could hear a pin drop. We were on the --th floor, so city noise was minimal and the elevators were insanely fast and you never had to wait long to get one. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. I liked the fact that there was a lot of serve-yourself conveniences, though I could see others viewing that as a detraction. For instance, you check in-out using an electronic kiosk, if you want an extra blanket or ironing board, you find a guest closet in the hallway and help yourself. They offered a gym, a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""living room"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to hang out in, and free bottled water on every floor at the elevators. The pub connected next door had very tasty and reasonably priced food.

The only negative I can come up with is the thermostat...it was impossible to figure out how to get the heat on, and the room was too chilly the whole time. We should have asked at the front desk as I'm sure they could have helped us, we just never made the time or forgot.

Our air conditioner struggled to cool the room (and it wasn't even full-on Florida heat outside) and we woke up to the feeling of dew everywhere in the morning. A major purpose of AC in Florida is to pull the moisture out of the air. The front grill of the AC kept falling open, too.

id10685,"I would definitely stay at Chicago's House of Blues Hotel again, despite a few 'caveat emptor' notes. First, they gave away our room the first of three nights. However, they put us up in the nearby, fancy Ritz-Carlton (a far superior but boring luxury hotel), even giving us cab fare to and from the Ritz. Why did this happen? 'A group came in,' the unsmiling young clerk said, as though bracing for a tirade. 
Thinking maybe it was a group of groupies for some band playing at the HOB next door, we didn't protest much. I suspected it also had to do with the fact that we booked through Expedia, but can't substantiate that. Expedia was great. After paying in advance and having Expedia alert the hotel in writing that we were arriving late and us calling the hotel directly that afternoon from the east coast to confirm ('yes, we have your reservation'), it sucked coming from the airport and being summarily told there was no room. But points to the HOB for putting us up at the Ritz-Carlton (which failed to give us the requested roll-away cot when they didn't have a room with two beds for two straight guys so one of us slept on the floor on a bedspread at the Ritz after coming in at - a.m. but that's another story). Anyway, next morning, we called the HOB to tell them we were coming over for our room. 'Yes, sir, we have three rooms with twin beds.' Only problem was, -- minutes later, the front desk tried to tell us there were no such rooms. Persistence paid off, and we soon found ourselves in a nice, spacious room on the --th floor. Everything else about the HOB hotel was good. In fact, they wanted to comp us with a Junior Suite after the trouble we were put through, but it didn't have two beds. Points for HOB Hotel. We liked the room decorations and colors, although the voodoo motif might have scared the heck out of kids or a sleepwalker. The room had a great view and floor-to-ceiling windows that actually opened! Excellent air-conditioning. The bathroom was outstanding, as was the maid service. Night-owls will like the opague curtains. The towels were thin, but the shower fine. Doors were solid and elevators efficient. 
The place seemed new and was very clean. No hookers seemed to be hanging around, although there was plentiful scenery in this chic location. The TV reception was poor and number of cable channels small. 
But we didn't go to watch TV so didn't matter. They give you a compiliation blues CD. Rooms have a good little stereo system, so bring your own CDs. The room was spacious, with a desk chair, but no lounge chairs. Nice hassock, though. The downstairs bar, which just won a Chicago magazine poll for best hotel bar, was dead as a doornail Sunday-Monday-Tuesday. But the adjacent House of Blues restaurant-concert hall was hopping. The HOB location is great, just over the Chicago River from the Loop subway stops, meaning you can take a subway from either O'Hare or Midway and walk to the hotel if you're traveling pretty lightly. The river itself is dwarfed by majestic architecture and topped by multiple picturesque bridges, a few blocks away from the site of the ---- Eastland ship disaster that killed --- people (plaque marks the site for history buffs). Besides a friendly Smith & Wollensky next door overlooking the river, the general area is kind of beautiful but kind of dead, so hop on the Red Line to Wrigleyville or just about anywhere in the city (we got a three-day $-- subway-bus pass that we wore out). Back to the hotel--the lobby looks like something out of Marrakesh; this is not your average expensive hotel, perhaps an acquired taste, but I would definitely stay there again.

id10697,"After staying there I now agree with other reviewers that this is a good hotel if you are only going to be in town for a few days I was there for a week and that was too long. I purchased a club level room, which is on the --st or --nd floor of the tower buliding and you get a lot of perks with that as well. 
When I arrived I had to wait over - hours for my room becuase the person that was staying in my assigned room had not bothered to check out yet. They offered me a room on a lower level but I would still get the club benefits but I decided to wait for the room I paid for not some lower level replacement. The staff also told me that a different club level room was available and that it would be -- minutes so that the staff could clean it so I took this option. An hour later I approached the desk for the third time and was given room keys and sent on my way. 
The club room on the --nd floor is nice but is not all that exciting to be honest, it has great views and has complimentary snacks and drinks as well as breakfast and dinner snacks but not enough nor quality enough to warrant what I paid to stay there.
About the thrid day into my vacation I decided to go and see what the breakfast in the club room had and arrived in time to see dirty plates everywhere and to find out that I was too late. After inquiring more information from the staff member that was up there I learned that upon check in I should have been given a welcome letter explaing all of this and vouchers for the restaraunt in the lobby as well. I went down to the front desk and explained my grief about not being informed. I was then given the welcome letter and some vouchers I was technically owed so all in all they did not really give me anything extra. Also I leanred from the club room staff memeber that the room would be closed for the next week which I was NOT AT ALL INFORMED ABOUT! This was truly upsetting. 
So for my trip that I paid for I got:
average staff members
below acceptable customer service
the rooms were good only becuase of the view (the rooms also had extremely firm mattresses that I was unable to sleep on and NO FRIDGE) I had to go and buy a cooler so my leftovers would not go to waste!!!

We had a gorgeous view of Monument Circle but the room window was fogged up either between the panes or very dirty on the outside. The light fixtures and bath fan were also in need of a good cleaning. My real disappointment was with the rooftop pool. The website portrayed the pool area as very nice and beautiful.

From the moment we first walked through the door, the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We arrived very early, so our luggage was safely stored while we explored NY. When we returned, our luggage was waiting for us in the room. The location is wonderful. Though we did a lot of walking to experience the many varied neighborhoods, subways to everywhere were a block or two away. The immediate surroundings offer a variety of excellent dining options( listen to the Chelsea Pines staff recommendations!

id10744,"I'm a member of Starwood Preferred Guest, so always look for a Sheraton or Westin when I take trips so I can use the points. This looks like a pretty new Westin and in my opinion looks like the nicest hotel in downtown Memphis - not counting the historic Peabody of course. 
One thing that drives me crazy is how much you have to park at hotels. They charge $-- - day to park in their garage. I used points, but this isn't a cheap hotel, and it seems like the more you spend for a room at some places, the more they keep getting you everywhere else! 
I also am disappointed that they charge so much for breakfast. I never can understand that you can spend $-- at a Holiday Inn Express - Hampton Inn, but you still get a free breakfast. When you stay at a hotel like this- you pay $--- - night and then they want you to pay $-- for a breakfast the next morning.
The room we had was really nice. No complaints. Very spacious, with a comfortable bed, big bathroom, nice amenities and cool view overlooking the FedEx Forum and Gibson Guitar Factory. Great location -- Beale Street is just around the corner. Great place if you plan on spending a lot of time in downtown Memphis - within walking distance. 
A couple service issues - concierge was not very knowledgable in terms of restaurant recommendations. Also, I went down there to ask for some more coffee for our room, since all they had was decaf, and there was no one at the front desk for about -- minutes. I found this mind boggling.

id10749,"Just got back from a week at the Murray Hill Inn. We chose this hotel from the reviews on trip advisor, as they all said pretty much the same thing: a good, bargain hotel in a good location.
We'd read that the hotel doesn't have an elevator so we came prepared with a backpack rather than the suitcase and we'd suggest others do the same. The room was a bit small, but hey, from what I hear that's the norm for Manhattan. Importantly though it was clean. We'd also read from the hundreds of other reviews we'd scoured that bed bugs are a big problem in Manhattan (it was actually on the news while we were there!), but we were fine. I did a suspicious check on the night we arrived and there were none to be seen.
The bathroom was excellent - it was very clean. The shower had excellent pressure and stayed at a constant temperature; it was by far one of the best showers we've ever encountered in our hotel travels. The towels were white and fluffy, if a little small.
The noise from outside was no problem. We were expecting it to be very loud but it wasn't at all. The only thing we noticed was the heating system clanked and wheezed a bit - it didn't trouble us but it might annoy others.
The reception staff were very helpful and friendly - we arrived at the hotel very late on the first night (at about midnight) but it was no problem. They also helped us on the last day when there was an error with our airport transfer - thanks again for that!
Finally, another of the hotel's advantages is the location. It's just around the corner from the Empire State Building and Macy's and the --th street subway is only - blocks down for when you want to go elsewhere. We would also recommend the Brasil Coffee House on the corner of --th and Lexington (a few doors down) for morning coffee-tea with a smile.

I spoke with someone named Peaches who was completely unprofessional, unfriendly and rude. I understand it's -am in NY right now but you'd think that they'd have someone decent representing their hotel since that could very well be the first impression.

REMEMBER THAT THIS IS PART OF THE LUXURY COLLECTION HOTELS!!
Valet parking is VERY expensive, $-- +tax a day with in and out privledges but we never needed our car. There is NO self parking. The valet guys and the doormen were more that willing to help you with any directions that you need.
The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""F"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" cable car will take you down to Fisherman's Warf. To pick up the car you cross Market Street to the depot. Cost is $-.-- a person and the ticket you get is usually good for - or so hours so be sure to hold onto it. The only problem with this mode of transportation is that once you get down to the Warf it is really difficult to get back. We waited over -- minutes for a car to come and finally decided to walk back. It's about a - hour walk but very, very enjoyable, just be sure to get a map form the hotel before you venture out. 
There are alot of bums in the area which was a little wierd but I guess that you get that is a big city. They really weren't a problem.
There is a lot just in the hotel area to keep you busy. The genuine cable cars run in the area which was really fun to see. Union Square is a must. Like I said before, be sure to get a street map at the hotel it will REALLY help people that have never been to the area before. 
Now to the hotel itself. Very nice but.........the sheets are AWFUL!! They felt like paper and the bed was old and VERY uncomfortable. When you are staying in a -+ star hotel and may be paying alot of money then why can't EVERYTHING be top of the line?? We are Starwood Gold members and so we were hoping for some sort of an upgrade. When we checked in we went to the preferred check in area and were told that we were given a superior king room. Cool right??? Well, wrong. When we entered the room it was a little small, understandable as to the location of this hotel and space is at a premium in the city. The room and bathroom were nice but cramped. When we looked out the window all that we could see was a part of the hotel. Brick wall with windows of other rooms. We thought if this is what gold and a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""superior"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room (To get gold status you have to either spend $--,--- or spend -- nights in any SPG property in a years time. Not that easy.) then we wonder what a normal not updated room was like. Don't get me wrong, the room was nice, it had its small problems but it was still nice. 
Room service which we didn't use seemed VERY expensive by looking at the menu. We visited the bar, Maxfield's to have a couple of drinks. We sat at the bar and waited several minutes to get waited on. We finally ordered and they also gave us a bowl of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""snack"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" type chips. As we were sitting there enjoying ourselves we noticed that when people left they took the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""snack"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" bowls and emptied part of the chips leaving some in and then refilled them....without washing them!!!! OMG!!! We talked to a rude manager and he said that he would take care of it. So BEWARE of Maxfield's and the drinks were VERY expensive around $---- for liquor and $--- a beer. That was the only experience we had with dining. We did notice that the buffet in the morning was around $----- a person. We went to the Starbucks and the McDonalds down the street instead. There is also a Del Taco, Subway, Westfield shopping center and several other stores and restaurants in the area. Also if you are down at the Warf go to Chippino restaurant and eat. VERY GOOD!! 
Just remember that you are smack dab in downtown and this is a great location. Just beware that if you are spending a lot of money that it's not always what you think it is. You also have to remember that you basically need to add $-- a day +TAX to the room for parking. We don't think that we would stay here again as I'm sure that there are other hotels in the area that may be just as good if not better that we would investigate first. Don't be fooled by the name or the look. It was a great experience but not really worth it.

id10759,"My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House for seven nights during the Thanksgiving holiday. Let me point out that Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House - a New York outfit bought it a couple of years ago. They're undergoing a huge $--- million renovation and the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Chicago"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" charm is being killed off in favor of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""New York-New York!!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" No offense, but if I want to go to New York City, I'll go. 
I have stayed at the Palmer House dozens of times in the last -- years. The last time prior to this visit was in ----. We decided to give the Palmer House one more try. While the ---- visit certainly lacked lustre, this visit was awful! I remember the graciousness of the hotel. Seeing all the staff happy and better yet, happy to see you! Now - we got the distinct impression we were a bother. The bellmen (and I use the term loosely) look at you when you walk it like you're cramping their style. We saw older guests lugging their cases up the steps, while the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""bellmen"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" yacked on with eachother!! In the entire week we were there, no one opened the door for us - no one greeted us. Shame on these new owners. Don't they know the first thing about customer service? First impressions? Evidently not.
The first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains. It was horrible and kept us up at night. Furthermore, the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean. We had to call housekeeping three times. Each time they would come, they didn't correct the problems! We gave up. We tried to change rooms but were told the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""We're completely sold out..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" line. We made our reservations for this trip in July!! We're Hilton Honors members - who cares! Anyway, the next day, we changed rooms and while the room was better, we still experienced problems with water, for instance, on two mornings, the water ran brown with silt! Not good.
The restaurant """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Lockwood"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" did not open until Thanksgiving Day, despite being advertised as opening weeks before. We made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior. I must say, the retaurant is terrible!! The whole layout stinks! The ceilings are far too low, the tables are bare, no table cloths, no flowers, no candles. Stark. The flow of the restaurant is tangled at best. No one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet, which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant. It's a zig-zig game getting to and from. Not only that, but we ate there for breakfast each morning (simply because our rate included it) and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable. There are plenty of waiters hanging about, but I don't think the manager has told them what to do yet!! No salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning. No coffee the next morning. Funny enough, we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience!! No kidding. I'd avoid this place. To think the hotel closed the wonderful French Quarter Restaurant and opened this??!! Unforgivable!! One more thing about this restaurant. The weird music choice. Who wants to hear Janice Joplin while eating Thanksgiving Dinner - or any other time for that matter!! The music was awful. Rap, New Age, Rock, ect. The manager said they were playing the staff's CD's. Wwhhhhaaat??? 
For a good restaurant, try Petterino's, The South Water Kitchen (WONDERFUL!!) and Harry Caray's. There's also a Corner Bakery that serves good coffee, sandwiches and pastries.
Lastly, the decor is no longer tasteful. The lobby looks awful with a bar sticking out in the middle and massive yellow chairs obstructing the once lovely view. There are people guzzling drinks and half eaten plates of food cluttering up tables - in the lobby!! Dreadful. No relaxation there at all anymore. You cannot even walk through it. It's a circus.

What are these new owners thinking??? A staff member told us the new owners also bought the old Carson Pirie Scott building directly across the street, which closed in February. I shutter to think.....
Well, with Marshall Field's selling out to Macy's, Carson's closed the Berghoff Restaurant closed, Trader Vic's closed and now the Palmer House in complete shambles...... Chicago is sinking fast. We sure hate to see it go..... What's next, are they going to raze Wrigley Field now? They seem to be the last man standing. Good-bye Chicago.
We did decide on one thing. No more Hilton Hotels for us. Even though Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House, their name is still attached. We're sticking with Marriott, who is fabulous. (We made the switch after our Palmer House trip three years ago)
There are plenty of hotel choices in Chicago. We stayed at the Marriott Renaissance last year and it was great. If we ever get up the nerve to come back to Chicago, that's where we'll be staying.",Edge,Mobile,0

id10764,"This is my second stay in the dream downtown. I will rate my first visit as decent, I got a good deal and the location is fabulous. I decided I could overlook the intense club-like vibe and overwhelming cologne smell in the lobby... because who doesn't want to stay in a spaceship for a few nights? 
Then came my second visit, two words: bad dream. First of all, a warning: If you value sleep do not stay on the --th floor. There is a club on the --th and you can count on the noise going until at least -:--am (I should note, I am not a light sleeper). Today, after a long day of meetings I was looking forward to coming up to my room to relax, NOT SO FAST! Guess what? The walls are paper thin! You idiot, you just moved to the fourth floor but you had better pray that your neighbors are quiet and go to bed at a reasonable hour, or that you have the same taste in music. If like me, however, they decided to crank up the techno music and bring the party to their room, count yourself in as their plus one and hang on for a ride into the middle of the night listening to your walls shake as they yell to be heard. 
I should note: I called the front desk and they sent security, this didn't really do much. The biggest issue is honestly the paper thin walls. It is kind of unreal how much you can hear, every word (so if you plan on having sex or private conversations, take note it will be a community experience for your neighbors).
At this point, I am beyond exhausted. I am paying a premium and haven't slept in two days. Being a frequent business traveller to NYC, I love a good deal that is in this neighborhood, but at this rate you couldn't pay me to return to the dream downtown.
Yes it's trendy, yes you might think $----$--- a night is a good deal... but do not be fooled. Unless your only plan is to party all night and sleep during the day (when it actually was quite peaceful) find another location!

id10772,"Our family recently returned from a one-nighter in Baltimore after staying at the Marriott Courtyard Downtown. Our stay was complimentary as an incentive for acquiring the Marriott Rewards Visa card. Nice perk.
Over the years we have stayed at some of the other properties in the harbor area such as:
Hyatt Regency Baltimore
Holiday Inn Downtown
Renaissance Harborplace
Baltimore Marriott Waterfront
As a comparison point, we were happy with the Courtyard in terms of its cleanliness and great location and see it as a decent option. The hotel is situated on Aliceanna Street near the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Little Italy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" area. There are quite a number of nice condominiums and hotels nearby as well as some brand name stores such as Haagen-Daas, Starbucks, etc. You have a nice walk (about -- minutes) to the National Aquarium, water taxis and the other amenities nearby. It can get pretty hot during the summer but its manageable. 
Check-in was smooth and the staff were friendly. The lobby was comfortable with the standard """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Courtyard Cafe"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", an attractive bar area and lounge. Our room was large and very clean with the fourth floor offering balcony views of the harbor and the area skyline. 
The fourth floor is also home to a nicely landscaped patio section complete with an indoor pool and fitness center. It's a rather large space where you face an an adjacent office complex connected to the hotel. It's attractive yet somewhat strange to peer in on folks hard at work during your leisure. 
On the downside, this is not a full-service property so there is no one to help with bags and, if you go on the weekend, a strong possibility of no baggage carts readily available. Our breakfast buffet was comped due to very slow service. The staff also seemed stressed and a little inexperienced. It wasn't a big deal as everyone was nice.

A circular driveway complete with water feature and two-way fireplace greeted us as we stepped into the rustic, lodge-like lobby. We felt as if we were far from home (really, only -- miles north of Seattle) because it felt like vacation. The reception desk was timely and courteous in checking in. We found at time of check-in we'd been upgraded from a waterside room to a waterfront room which turned out to be just breathtaking! Views of Elliott Bay on a perfect, sunny day greeted us as soon as we entered our room. Our room was spacious, our bed perfectly comfortable, and the bathroom beautiful with its slate shower and flooring. Perfect, relaxing and beautiful night away. We had reservations at the restaurant, Six Seven....the food was divine! The wait staff impeccable and professional, yet friendly. The concierge was most helpful in ordering us a taxi downtown. The next morning, we ordered breakfast in our room and were again blown away by the quality of food....we're still talking of it a day later! Overall, The Edgewater is a place we will return to and recommend to our friends and family.",Edge,Tablet,1
id10803,"i must admit I was looking forward to staying at the hotel after reading the reviews and awards.
I just am going to say that this place is not my cup of tea.
If this is the type of etablishment that wins awards these days, then Trip Advisor has a problem.
It was just mediocre- people were nice, breakfast was okay, etc., but nothing to write home about.
The trip started pretty badly as I had Casa arrange an airport pickup. The driver was tremendously unprofessional (a very fat, dirty and smelly version of Danny DeVito) and the car smelled like someone had slept in it for three days.
I complained to the Casa- and they were very understanding and would look into it.
However, if this boutique is all that it is said to be via comments, I would think that they use a first-rate car service.
In any event, it was probably my mistake as I should have used Select Seven or some other service that I knew would be good.
In all, not worth making the effort to come here. It is clean and well-kept, but I could stay at another comparable HOTEL (not a boutique) per night and probably get better service.
This is more for people that don't come to NYC that often and think that it is a city filled with ingrates and people who would soon rather kick you in the teeth than open a door for you.
For those people, just a word of advice: There are a lot of nicer hotels- with people just as nice as Casa. I smell: A TOURIST TRAP here.",InternetExplorer,Tablet,0

The bed and sheets are very comfortable, the bathroom spotlessly clean with mod sink and shower (and H-- toiletries), and the extra touches like the signature lamps and mirror are very cool. And the rates are very affordable. (We got a Renovated Queen for $--.) 
A couple of drawbacks were the fact that the heating system hasn't been upgraded with the rest of the hotel (yet) and was quite loud. Parking is less than ideal, but really no different than the rest of the city. 
Depending on your preferences, the renovation is either a bonus or a letdown. If you're looking for a cool boutique hotel, you'll love it. But if you're hoping to re-create a shot-for-shot scene from the Hitchcock classic, you're out of luck.",IE,Mobile,1

id10820,"We stayed at the JW Marriott as a family a weekend in August. We rented a suite with two ajoining rooms. The suite was huge and spacious, nicely appointed, very clean. The couple of small issues were a lack of drawer space. Travelling with kids, we really like to unpack and feel organized and there simply was very little drawer space to do this, so we lived out of suit cases. There was plenty of room in the suite for a dresser, but it simply wasn't there. Also, the bathrooms were somewhat lacking for a high end hotel. There is not a lot of counter space and not a seperate room for the toliet. Also, the walls are very thin and I woke up both mornings becasue of people talking outside of my room-it seemed like they were right in our room with us.
Overall, it is a very nice hotel-however, be expecting big and crowded. We had just come from a four seasons in jackson hole, so it took some getting used to.
We were trapped on the runway at the airport because of a bomb threat at the airport. We finally got to the hotel after a long day of travel and the front desk told us that the restaurant at the pool-water park closed at - (it was about -:--) 
We rushed to the pools so the kids could go on the water slides and we could order food-unfortunately, the food service ended at -...so we were out of luck--we were starving and now wet...so we walked to the sports bar-where they told us it would be -- min wait for a table (even though there were a lot of tables open...) so I grabbed the manager, Chelsea, told her our story and she was very helpful and we were seated within minutes. I really appreciated her kindness and attention. Thank you Chelsea for really coming to our rescue! The food was good, service a little slow, but decent.
Prior to our stay-I had called the concierge and asked for recommendations on how to plan our few days at the hotel. She recommended staying on site on saturday because of all the kids activities and heading to Seaworld on Friday.
When we were at the pool on thursday-we asked about booking a cabana for saturday, only to find out they were all booked. This was very frustrating to me for a few reasons-first, in my opinion, if you call and ask for the concierge's advice and they suggest staying on site for a saturday-they should mention the cabana rental. The place was an absolute zoo on saturday. By am, there were absolutely no chairs left--NONE! line of at least guests waiting to get their wrist band to get into the water park. secondly, we were staying in the highest room category on site. At most high end hotels, the guests staying in the highest end rooms are at least offered the ammenties such as a cabana (not for free, just the ability to rent one)...
Thankfully, the concierge manager Donna was wonderful and was able to reserve an end-cap cabana for us and it saved our last day on our vacation. Without that, between the crowds and the heat, it literally would have been miserable. Thank you Donna for your help and understanding.
Honestly, I felt like I was given bad advice by the concierge. The hotel is way over-crowded on the weekend. It is unmanageable and unpleasant. I wish we had gone to seaworld on saturday and stayed at the hotel on fri.
In general, this is a nice, clean hotel. It is just too big for my taste. The crowds were like a vegas hotel. The service was just ok because of the size. We ordered room service every morning and every morning, something was not right.
The water park is great, my kids love waterparks and the slides are big and fun. 
If I were to go back to this hotel, it would certainly not be on a weekend. I wouldn't even consider going on a weekend. Maybe it was because it was the summer...but just crazy.
Also, every time we called the front desk for something, we were on hold for a few minutes.
In short, nice grounds, pretty hotel, clean and big rooms-new, service couldn't keep up with the crowds.
Chelsea and Donna were life savers. They were a highlight of great service during a stay full of very mediocre service.

id10824,"The property itself is clean, well-presented and well-maintained. However, for an airport hotel, and a property which does a great deal
of it's business with flight crews, it certainly does not go out of it's way to ensure that the crews are indulged. 
We are Marriott Rewards customers (albeit the basic level), and were assigned a room on the ground floor - with a very narrow door, making
it hard to push our luggage through. This was almost laughable since the rooms on the opposite side of the hall had standard sized doors. 
As other reviewers have noted, internet access is charged at $--.-- plus tax per day ... and parking is $--! So, a relatively inexpensive
room rate is pushed up substantially by the add-ons. So, if you have no car, and no need to use the internet - then this hotel is a relative bargain; if you need those accoutrement then the price rises
rapidly - and I would recommend the Doubletree down off of Sepulveda.
The other matter I took issue with during my stay was the large gathering that was held the morning of our departure. Since we were on the ground floor, and since there was an entry-exit at the end of our hall, it became very noisy in the morning as the group filed in, and furthermore, many members of that group were smokers so the hall was quite malodorous by the time we departed. Apparently, no effort was made to prevent the attendees from smoking in the lodging hallways.
On the bright side, corporate policy allows for a - PM departure upon
request - although that is done via the internet before one's arrival.
In summary, I would like to compliment the staff - to a person, they were pleasant and affable. To the management - rather than nickel-and-diming your flight crews, why not bundle everything so they will want to visit your property when traveling on leisure? 
In all honesty, I probably would not return. More because I was disenchanted with the ground level room and the noise than for any other reason. Otherwise, it has the feel of a mid-level airport hotel.",Internet Explorer,Mobile,0
